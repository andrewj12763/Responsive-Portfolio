				<p>
					<img class="headshot" src="assets/images/ProfilePicture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">I was born in Lehi and grew up around computers. I worked in several industries ranging from solar to mobile testing. I had many opportunities to grow in the quality control and analysis fields and found QA Engineering to be my career goal. I love the outdoors, hunting, fishing, and camping. I spend all my free time out in the mountains or exercising for fun. I like to learn foreign languages. I speak Danish the best out of all of them but I understand Swedish, Norwegian, and a little german. I took a few courses on mechanics and love to work on cars especially classic cars. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I am now working for CIT electronics as a mobile tester. I love working in good environments with fun teams. I have had many chances to test websites and software, and am now in pursuit of the QA job as we speak. I spend as much time as I can learning to program and improve my skills to help with my career.
